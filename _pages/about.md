Hey, my name is Jacob and I am an aspiring controls engineer who recently completed a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia with the Control Engineering Laboratory. Throughout my studies, I developed a keen interest in the intersection of control theory and machine learning and how aspects of machine learning can be adapted to improve the performance of more traditional control algorithms. At the moment, I reside in Vancouver, Canada and am seeking opportunities to pursue my interest in bridging the gap between control theory and machine learning to solve complex control problems in our everyday world.

My academic background is in Engineering Physics, which I majored in during my undergraduate degree at Queen's University.  While at Queen’s, I was able to develop a strong fundamental understanding of key concepts in math, physics, and computing. As part of the Queen’s Space Engineering Team, I also worked on developing prototype Mars Rovers, which sparked my interest in controls. Upon graduating, I was able to apply the knowledge I gained at Queen’s to a large-scale, open-ended design problem while working as a research engineer out of the CEA Paris-Saclay in France. My work focused on streamlining the data acquisition and analysis software in addition to the electronics associated with the operation of a spherical gaseous dark matter detector. The technical skills I acquired during my time in France coupled with my strong interest in controls, ultimately led me to pursue a master's degree with a focus in Control Engineering.

Beyond engineering, controls, and machine learning, my interests are quite wide ranging. On one hand, I love taking time for myself, settling into the couch to read the latest from Michael Connelly or nodding along to rock music. On the other hand, I’m a very social person who enjoys snowboarding, backcountry touring, camping, and hiking with friends. I am also an avid Leafs and Raptors fan (having grown up just outside of Toronto) and love the comradery that comes with this fandom as much as I love the sports themselves.

I am easy going, mild-mannered, and quick to find humour in almost every situation. I am an avid learner who is always consuming new information (often to the detriment of a good night’s sleep), and am most productive when I have a full workload. If you think I may be the right fit to work with you or your company, or simply found a point of interest on my website, please reach out. I would love to connect.
