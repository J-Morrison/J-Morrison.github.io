Machine learning is a topic that has recently become prominent in professional sports, and among other applications has been used as a match outcome prediction tool. Despite this movement, the National Hockey League (NHL) has not garnered much attention from the machine learning community. With that in mind this project was completed with the goal of validating machine learning as a match outcome prediction tool for NHL regular season games. The project uses an expanded data set that has never before been employed in this sort of research, along with improved data preprocessing and analysis methods compared to those featured in related works. This led to the confirmation that machine learning is indeed a useful tool in NHL match outcome prediction. Various methods were examined and it was determined that using a Neural Network with 11 hidden layers led to the best prediction, correctly classifying 60% of the 1079 games the model was tested on. This is a very positive result, obtaining a 6% improvement over the baseline level, which arises from making predictions with a decision stump. Further, this project examined which stats are most influential in predicting NHL success and determined that advanced stats such as Corsi and Expected Goals For are most important in match outcome prediction.

I completed this project for a graduate level course on machine learning and data mining. The full pdf document for the project can be accessed by clicking below.
