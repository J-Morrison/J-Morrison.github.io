Significant cost and energy savings can be realized by optimizing the controller for a domestic hot water heating system. As a result, a typical heating system was modelled, and this model was used to determine what type of control scheme is best able to preserve system functionality in an efficient manner. When it comes to a hot water heating system, the control problem is to maintain the temperature at the top of the system’s storage tank at approximately 60 degrees celcius while minimizing cost and energy use. In total, four controllers were designed; an industry standard On/Off controller, a constant level controller, a state feedback controller with an integrator, and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller with an integrator. These controllers were then tested through simulations on the developed model over 48 hour test periods. Ultimately, it was determined that the LQR controller has the best performance, using the least energy of all explored controllers while consistently maintaining the target temperature at the top of the hot water heating system’s storage tank.

I completed this project for a graduate level course on modern control engineering. The full pdf document for the project can be accessed by clicking below.
