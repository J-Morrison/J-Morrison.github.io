*Completed April 2019*

This project is based on a paper called "Adaptive Air-Fuel Ratio Regulation for Port-Injected Spark-Ignited Engines Based on a Generalized Predictive Control Method" by L. Meng et al, which can be found in its entirety [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/1/173).

I completed this project for a graduate level course on self tuning control. The full pdf document for the project can be accessed by clicking below.
